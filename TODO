* Catch if the script aborts and cleanup:
  - unmount the volume
  - delete incomplete .dmg?

* move the temporary .dmg into /tmp resp use mktemp

* make some of the settings configurable via a config
  file??
  On the other hand, editing the shell script is quite
  easy as it is...

* The initial dmg currently is set to 50 MB. Make this
  variable (e.g. use "du" on the content dir and add some
  margin)
